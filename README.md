## Project Description

- Question: Does trial history and task engagement differentially influence neuronal activity across regions?
- Background: Throughout a given task, performance fluctuates over time. The factors governing these fluctuations and the relative contribution of various brain regions is unknown. Past studies suggest that pupil dilation as well as trial history may correlate with brain state. We will use the Steinmetz data set to investigate if pupil diameter, reward history, and trial difficulty explain neuronal activity.
